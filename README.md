Design of OpenMP-based Parallel Neighborhood-based [Link prediction] approaches.

<br>

Link prediction aids in rectifying inaccuracies within various graph algorithms resulting from unaccounted-for or overlooked links within networks. However, numerous existing works adopt a baseline approach, incurring unnecessary computational overheads due to its elevated time complexity. Moreover, many investigations concentrate on smaller graphs, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions.

This code repository presents two parallel approaches, named **IHub** and **LHub**, which predict links through neighborhood-based similarity metrics on large graphs. *LHub*, a heuristic approach, additionally disregards significant hubs, grounded on the notion that high-degree nodes contribute minimal similarity among their neighbors.

On a server equipped with dual 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors, *LHub* demonstrates an average speed improvement of `1019√ó` over *IHub*, particularly evident in web graphs and social networks, while sustaining comparable prediction accuracy. Notably, *LHub* achieves a link prediction rate of `38.1ùëÄ` edges/s and enhances performance by a factor of `1.6√ó` for every doubling of threads.

Below we plot the time taken by the *IHub* and *LHub* approaches for link prediction using the best similarity measure, on 13 different graphs, with `10^-2|E|` and `0.1|E|` unobserved edges.

Below we plot the speedup of *LHub* wrt *IHub*, on 13 different graphs, with `10^-2|E|` and `0.1|E|` unobserved edges. *LHub* surpasses *IHub* by, on average, `1622√ó` and `415√ó`, on `10^-2|E|` and `0.1|E|` unobserved edges respectively. Further, on the *sk-2005* graph with `0.1|E|` edges removed, *LHub* achieves a link prediction rate of `38.1M` edges/s.

Finally, we plot the F1 score for links predicted with the *IHub* and *LHub* approaches. The *IHub* approach achieves an average F1 score of `1.8√ó10^‚àí2` and `1.1√ó10^‚àí1` when predicting `10^‚àí2|E|` and `0.1|E|` edges, respectively. In comparison, the *LHub* approach achieves F1 scores, averaging `3.2√ó10^‚àí2` and `9.8√ó10^‚àí2` , respectively. Thus, the *LHub* approach predicts links with similar F1 scores, while being significantly faster than the *IHub* approach.
